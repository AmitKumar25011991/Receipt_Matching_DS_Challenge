# Model Development
## Steps:- 
1. Model Development
2. 2. Correlation Check
3. Multicollinearity check
4. EDA (Bivariate - woe and event rate)
5. Train-Test (30%) split
6. SMOTE/Oversampling on Train data
7. Build mutiple models using different algo's - Logistic Regression, Random forest,  Gradient Boosting, SVM, KNN and SVM
8. Tested each of the models performance on "Test" (unbiased original sample)
9. Random forest came out with best performance with ROC of > 81 (Note: Please do not test your model on a sample taken out of oversampled data as it will lead to misleading results. Our models should always be tested on original/unbiased/untouched test set as this set best represents the real time data)
